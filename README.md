# My Journey through Machine Learning

 Machine Learning has received a lot of attention, and rightly so. It has
 revolutionized several industries it has been introduced in.

 I want to try to understand the technology behind Machine Learning for several
 reasons:

 *  I want to stay up-to-date on the most innovative technologies in the tech
    industry
 *  Machine Learning opens up a lot of opportunities for programming
    applications that I can't solve with simple code

Following is a chronoligical "journal" of my journey to achieving proficiency
with Machine Learning. Here is a table of contents of what I've learned:
