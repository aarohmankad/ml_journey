# My Journey through Machine Learning

 Machine Learning has received a lot of attention, and rightly so. It has
 revolutionized several industries it has been introduced in.

 I want to try to understand the technology behind Machine Learning for several
 reasons:

 *  I want to stay up-to-date on the most innovative technologies in the tech
    industry
 *  Machine Learning opens up a lot of opportunities for programming
    applications that I can't solve with simple code

Following is a chronoligical "journal" of my journey to achieving proficiency
with Machine Learning. Here is a table of contents of what I've learned:

| Topic |
| ----- |
| [Linear Regression](./house_prices) |
| [Regularized Logistic Regression](./titanic_survival) |

## June 2017 (Month 1)

*   Enrolled in and began
    [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)
    on Coursera
    +   Finished Weeks 1 - 3

*   [Worked on Kaggle's House Prices dataset](./house_prices)
    +   Accuracy achieved on training data through Linear Regression: 92.6%
    +   Note for next time: Use [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) for dataset
        manipulation

*   [Worked on Kaggle's Titanic Survival dataset](./titanic_survival)
    +   Accuracy on testing set through Regularized Logistic Regression: 74.2%
